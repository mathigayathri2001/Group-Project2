## Description
**S**pam-**N**um-**T**racker! 

Spam Numbers Tracker and Renderer for Analysis

An application that hosts a database service for users to report spam calls received on their phones.
The database would serve as a central repository to hold list of spam numbers reported by all users registered with the application.
Users in turn can subscribe (if interested) for getting  updated numbers from the database (so that they could add filters in their phones to block calls if received in the future).

The numbers held in the database would serve as inputs to cyber or security departments for analysis.

### Directions for Future Development
* Add capability to search internally for existence of reported number in the database and do not add if the number       already exists in the database
* Delete number reported by a user (from his login)
* View reported numbers by city
* Add support for the application to integrate with a phoneâ€™s contact application to update and filter/block spam call numbers (received from the database)
